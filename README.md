# Welcome to the **Online Store Tech Test** repository

![Online Store Tech Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcin-piekarski/online-store-tech-test/main/images/online-store-tech-test-header.png)

This repository contains a _simple_ online store design (category page and cart pop over) as well as instructions for this test.

## Objective

The objective of this test is to gauge your skills around React (Next.js), API usage, etc.

## Instructions

We need you to use the below dependencies to build a server-side rendered online store using either the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5oqdRArPHbN33QJjFy1kiG/tech-test-store?node-id=0%3A1) OR [PNG](https://github.com/marcin-piekarski/online-store-tech-test/blob/main/images/online-store-tect-test-design.png) design as a reference.

## Dependencies

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5oqdRArPHbN33QJjFy1kiG/tech-test-store?node-id=0%3A1) / [PNG](https://github.com/marcin-piekarski/online-store-tech-test/blob/main/images/online-store-tect-test-design.png) - A design of an online stores category page with a cart pop over
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) by Vercel - The React Framework
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) / [Fake Store API Docs](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) - Fake store rest API for your e-commerce or shopping website prototype
- [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) - Beautiful hand-crafted SVG icons

## What we're looking for...

1. Fork of this Git repository containing a project which includes the above dependencies
2. Category page that displays products fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) with each product card displaying an add to cart button
3. Dismissable cart pop over which lists products, shows the order total, allows removal of products and displays a console.log or alert on checkout

## What we're leaving up to you...

- It's up to you on how simple/complex you'd like to make the project
- Add whatever additional dependencies that you'd like (ie. styling, fetch, etc, etc)
- Use whatever project structure your comfortable with
- As a stretch goal, it'd be fantastic to see some form of testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork this Git Repository
2. Setup your project using the above dependencies
3. Build your project using the provided design as a guide
4. Share your Git Repository when your ready
