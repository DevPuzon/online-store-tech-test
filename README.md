This repository contains a design of a *fake* online store for the purposes of a technical test.

## Objective

We need you to use **key dependencies** listed below to build a server-side rendered online store using the [Figma]([https://www.figma.com/file/5oqdRArPHbN33QJjFy1kiG/tech-test-store?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/5oqdRArPHbN33QJjFy1kiG/tech-test-store?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=x0nGLpgXwBZtJ90B-1))
) design as a reference.

## Key Dependencies

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5oqdRArPHbN33QJjFy1kiG/tech-test-store?node-id=0%3A1)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) / [Fake Store API Docs](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) - Fake store rest API for your e-commerce or shopping website prototype

4. Product listing page that displays products fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) with each product card displaying an add to cart button
5. Dismissable overlay for the cart, checkout and order confirmation
6. Mock shipping/payment form in the checkout overlay with some basic validation
7. Product content that's server rendered

## What we're leaving up to you...

- It's up to you on how simple/complex you'd like to make the project
- Add whatever additional dependencies that you'd like (ie. styling, fetch, etc, etc)
- Use whatever project structure you're comfortable with
- Use typescript if you'd like
- As a stretch goal, it'd be fantastic to see some form of testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork this Git Repository
2. Setup your project using the above dependencies
3. Build your project using the provided design as a guide
4. Share your Git Repository when your ready
