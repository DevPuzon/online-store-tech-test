- It's up to you on how simple/complex you'd like to make the project
- Add whatever additional dependencies that you'd like (ie. styling, fetch, etc, etc)
- Use whatever project structure you're comfortable with
- Use typescript if you'd like
- As a stretch goal, it'd be fantastic to see some form of testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork this Git Repository
2. Setup your project using the above dependencies
